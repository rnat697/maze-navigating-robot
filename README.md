# Maze Navigating Robot using PSoC
This a semester-long project in a Design: Hardware Software Systems course during 2022. We worked with a custom two-wheeled robot2 to navigate a "maze". The path of the maze is projected as a line from a ceiling mounted projector. The walls of the maze are not projected. The robot comes with electronics to drive the motors and provides an interface to a Cypress PSoC 5 development kit - the Kit 059. The motors include a gearbox and rotation sensors.

During the course of this project, we designed and built a sensor PCB to locate and position our robot on the projected line. From there, we programmed the PSoC, in C, to complete one of several objectives. 
- Develop C code and demonstrate that the robot can move between any two valid locations. 
- The robot must pick up items/food along the way to the end destination.
- The shortest path must be taken. Assume the map is available within the C code.

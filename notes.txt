projector gives analogue signal of light,
sends out black and white light.

Read analogue signal into psoc, will need to use a digital filter, amplification
will need 7 for 7 sensors, trade off versus processing time.

More that is soldered more precision is needed to solder on the reference voltages.




Motor
inductance and resistance, connect multimeter to two terminals in motor u will measure resistance in the the motor,dc multimeter gives measurement of resistor, ac will give you something better?\



Drive current into motor, to make it spin, if u mechanically drive the shaft(move it) produces a voltage,lens law change in field electrical potential. THis voltage is called back emf if the motor.

Starting it off the first time,if u apply the full 12 v at the start  a large burst of current going through that current is exactly equal to V/r in the circuit. Its necessary to make the motor spin.

Peak current max of 1.5A to get it going.

Turning
slow one motor down while other.

How to vary voltage digitally
PWM,changing duty cycle how long u switch something on and off.
psoc has a PWM value adjust compare value,




Psoc design is already done located in file lecture is 5/07/22 9:36

never connect the motor directly to the digital io pins.



H bridge-
william circuit, the one with 4 resistors 2 in parallel 2 and the H being the resistor in the middle.m
